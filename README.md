## Installation

As of now, only the back-end is in development. As this web app is supposed to be my tool/guide to learn web development using JS, the client section will be added soon.


```
git clone https://github.com/mageshkumaar/track-it.git // Clone the repository
cd track-it
cd server
npm install // Install the dependencies
npm start // Starts the server
```
 
 ## Tests

 Am learning how to test a NodeJs app using Mocha, Chai and Supertest. Once I get the hang of it, tests will be added to the app.

## Notice

This repository contains code using which I'm attempting to learn NodeJs, TDD, MongoDB, VueJs etc. This is not a real-world/commerical application. Any resemblance is strictly co-incidental.
